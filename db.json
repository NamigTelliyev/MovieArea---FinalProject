Their aim is to write their names in history as the worst people in the world by stealing something that cannot be stolen. Before this, this team of terrible villains committed various thefts all over the city, but when these thefts were not big enough to make their names known to the whole world, they were unaware of what would happen to them when the team decided to steal an artifact that they could handle and was valuable to everyone.When the team prepares a big plan and starts a robbery, not everything goes as they want. The team that finally caught up is now in the police car and unfortunately they have been caught. When they are caught, Mr. Wolf, the jackal and smartest of the group, comes up with an amazing idea: to make them feel sorry and get away with it. When this idea of ​​making them feel sorry for the other members of the team makes sense, the team that makes them feel sorry for the police gets away with it, which is the strange part. But of course this has a price. But this price will be very difficult for Miss Tarantula, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Piranha, Mr. Shark and Mr. Snake. The only condition and rule to get away with the job is to be good. But this rule will be quite difficult for all of them. This rule set by Professor Marmalede is quite the opposite for the team of terrible villains. Lady Tarantula, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Piranha, Mr. Shark and Mr. Snake, the scary evil team that has entered the hardest period of their lives, have to be good now. This will undoubtedly be the biggest and most difficult test in their lives. ",
